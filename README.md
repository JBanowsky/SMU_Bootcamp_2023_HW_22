This activity is the SMU Boot Camp Module 22 Challenge.
All code was resourced from the SMU Boot Camp Class.

CODE IS RUN USING GOOGLE COLABORATORY

SMU Boot Camp Stater Code used for:
"https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.2/22-big-data/home_sales_revised.csv"

Programs used:
SparksSQL
Google Colaboratory
GitHub

Objective: "In this challenge, you'll use your knowledge of SparkSQL to determine key metrics about home sales data. Then you'll use Spark to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache a temporary table, and verify that the table has been uncached."

After using the starter code and a setting up a temporary table, I answered 3 questions using SQL queries. 
The 4th question was repreated 3 total times. Once uncached, once cached, and once after partitioning on a parquet. 

The cached had the fastest completion time.
